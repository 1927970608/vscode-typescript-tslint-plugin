Adds [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) to VS Code using the [TypeScript TSLint language service plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-tslint-plugin).

Please refer to the [tslint documentation](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) for how to configure the linting rules.

## Usage
> ‚ùó **Important**: If you also have the [vscode-tslint][vscode-tslint] extension in VS Code installed, please disable it to avoid that files are linted twice.*

This extension works out of the box with VS Code's built-in version of TypeScript. You do not need to configure the plugin in your `tsconfig.json` if you are using VS Code's version of TypeScript.

If you are [using a workspace version of typescript](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions), you must currently configure the TS Server plugin manually by following [these instructions][usage]

## Differences with the [vscode-TSLint][vscode-tslint] extension

- Configuration options for TSLint are specified [inside the `tsconfig.json`][usage].

- The implementation as a TypeScript server plugin enables to shares the program representation with TypeScript. This is more efficient than the current `vscode-tslint` implementation. The current TSLint implementation needs to reanalyze a document that has already been analyzed by the TypeScript language server. 

- `vscode-tslint` can only lint one file a time. It therefore cannot support [semantic tslint rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/type-checking/) that require the type checker. The language service plugin doesn't have this limitation. To overcome this limitation is a key motivation for reimplementing the extension.

- This extension requires that the `tslint` and `typescript` modules are installed either locally or globally. The `vscode-tslint` extension will use the tslint module that is installed closest to the linted file. To install tslint and typescript globally you can run `npm install -g tslint typescript`.
