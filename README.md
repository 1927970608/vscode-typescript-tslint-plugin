[![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)

Adds [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) to VS Code using the [TypeScript TSLint language service plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-tslint-plugin).

Please refer to the [tslint documentation](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) for how to configure the linting rules.

## Usage
> ‚ùó **Important**: If you also have the [vscode-tslint][vscode-tslint] extension in VS Code installed, please disable it to avoid that files are linted twice.*

This extension works out of the box with VS Code's built-in version of TypeScript. You do not need to configure the plugin in your `tsconfig.json` if you are using VS Code's version of TypeScript.

If you are [using a workspace version of typescript](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript#_using-newer-typescript-versions), you must currently configure the TS Server plugin manually by following [these instructions][usage]

## Configuration

You can either configure the TSLint extension using a `tsconfig` or `jsconfig` as described  [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/typescript-tslint-plugin#configuration-options), or configure it with VS Code settings. This requires VS Code 1.30+ and TS 3.2+. Note the VS Code based configuration override the `tsconfig` or `jsconfig` configuration.

 * `tslint.configFile` - The configuration file that tslint should use instead of the default tslint.json. A relative file path is resolved relative to the project root.

 * `tslint.jsEnable` - Enable/disable tslint for `.js` files. Default is `false`.

 * `tslint.ignoreDefinitionFiles` - Control if TypeScript definition files should be ignored. Default is `true`.

 * `tslint.exclude` - A glob or an array of globs. Any file matching these globs will not be linted.

 * `tslint.alwaysShowRuleFailuresAsWarnings` - Always show rule failures as warnings, ignoring the severity configuration in the tslint.json configuration.

 * `tslint.suppressWhileTypeErrorsPresent` - Suppress tslint errors from being reported while other errors are present.


## Differences with the [vscode-TSLint][vscode-tslint] extension

- Configuration options for TSLint are specified [inside the `tsconfig.json`][usage].

- The implementation as a TypeScript server plugin enables to shares the program representation with TypeScript. This is more efficient than the current `vscode-tslint` implementation. The current TSLint implementation needs to reanalyze a document that has already been analyzed by the TypeScript language server. 

- `vscode-tslint` can only lint one file a time. It therefore cannot support [semantic tslint rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/type-checking/) that require the type checker. The language service plugin doesn't have this limitation. To overcome this limitation is a key motivation for reimplementing the extension.

- This extension requires that the `tslint` and `typescript` modules are installed either locally or globally. The `vscode-tslint` extension will use the tslint module that is installed closest to the linted file. To install tslint and typescript globally you can run `npm install -g tslint typescript`.
